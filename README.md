# Assignment: Emoji Translator


https://github.com/zhouy185/emoji_mapping/blob/main/emoji_map.ipynb

In this exercise, you will build a simple emoji translator in Python.
The goal is to replace certain emotion adjectives (like happy, sad, angry) with matching emojis.

# Task

You are given a dictionary of words mapped to emojis:

```python
EMOJI_MAP = {
    "happy": "😀",
    "joyful": "😄",
    "excited": "🤩",
    "proud": "😌",
    "calm": "🙂",
    "confident": "😎",
    "playful": "😜",
    "silly": "🤪",
    "angry": "😡",
    "frustrated": "😤",
    "sad": "😢",
    "lonely": "🥺",
    "scared": "😱",
    "worried": "😟",
    "tired": "😴",
    "confused": "🤔",
    "surprised": "😮",
    "loving": "❤️",
    "grateful": "🙏"
}
```

Write Python codes in **emoji_map.ipynb** to:

* Splits the input text into words.

* Replaces words found in EMOJI_MAP with their emoji.

* Keeps all other words unchanged.

For example, "I am happy but also tired" will be converted to "I am 😀 but also 😴"

## 🚀 How to Work on the Assignment

### Step 1: Open the Notebook in Colab
1. Go to your private assignment repository on GitHub.
2. Click on **`emoji_map.ipynb`**.
3. Click the "Open in colab" badge. If not visible, then in the browser’s address bar, replace
`https://github.com/` with `https://colab.research.google.com/github/`
4. Press Enter → your notebook opens in Colab.

### Step 2: Do the Assignment
- Edit the code cells in Colab.
- Run the cells to test your work.
- Changes are only in Colab until you save them back to GitHub.

### Step 3: Submit (Save Back to GitHub)
1. In Colab, click **File → Save a copy in GitHub**.
2. In the dialog:
- **Repository**: choose your private assignment repo (e.g., `emoji_mapping-username`).
